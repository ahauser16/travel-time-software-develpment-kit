# TravelTime platform SDKs generated by OpenAPI Generator

SDKs were generated using:
* [OpenAPI Generator v3.3.4](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/v3.3.4)
* [TravelTime platform OpenAPI Specification v1.1.1](https://github.com/igeolise/traveltime-platform-openapi-specification/blob/v1.1.1/traveltime-spec.yml)

#### Known issues:
* Generated SDKs cannot parse error response. You will need to wrap sdk calls and catch exceptions, then parse the [error response](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/error-response)
* [Time Map](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/time-map) Supports multiple output formats, but the generated SDKs can only handle `application/json`

#### How to update the sdks
1. Install [Ammonite](http://ammonite.io)
1. Run `amm update.sc`
1. Commit changes

The initial run will clone OpenAPI Generator and build it. You can run `amm update.sc true` for subsequent runs to not build it again.
